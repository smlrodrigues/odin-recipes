    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>3 cups marinara sauce, divided</li>
        <li>2 (22 ounce) packages frozen cheese ravioli</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Squeeze thawed spinach between several layers of paper towels to remove as much excess moisture as possible. Transfer spinach to a medium bowl and stir in ricotta cheese, egg, salt, pepper, and garlic powder until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour 1 cup marinara sauce in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Arrange 1/2 of the ravioli in a single layer over the sauce. Pour 1 cup sauce over the ravioli, then spread ricotta mixture over the sauce and top with 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Top with remaining ravioli, remaining sauce, and remaining mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Cover with parchment paper and then cover tightly with foil. Freeze for up to one month.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place frozen covered lasagna in the preheated oven and bake for 1 1/2 hours. Uncover and bake until golden and bubbly, about 20 more minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
